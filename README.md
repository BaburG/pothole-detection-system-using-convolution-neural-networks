# Pothole Detection System
Detecting potholes on roads using images processed through a CNN model. This is not a realtime system but I'm hoping to make it realtime for the application purposes. As of now the model simply processes a single image and tells whether the image has a pothole or not. Note that the model does not tell the number of potholes in the images. That's something for the future and we'll use YOLO (You Only Look Once architecture) for that.
